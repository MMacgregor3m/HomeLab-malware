# HomeLab-Malware

<h2>Objectives:</h2>

•	Set up two VM machines. The first one would be the Attacker/Deploy system Kali Linux the second Windows 10 Pro Defender/Victim.

•	Kali system will use Nmap and MSF venom to deploy a malware attack using a reverse TCP 

•	Windows 10 pro will run Splunk to monitor

<h3>Experience:</h3>
As an aspiring SOC analyst, I was eager to expand my skills through a malware lab, which provided an excellent opportunity to showcase my capabilities. The lab offered a comprehensive overview of various industry tools and frameworks, allowing me to gain hands-on experience. Working with SIEMs, MSF Venom, and Splunk was both enjoyable and incredibly informative.
<h3>Project:</h3>
This lab simulates a real cyber-attack and endpoint detection and response. Utilizing MyDfir's YouTube Home lab project, I will use virtual machines to represent both the threat and victim systems. The attack machine will deploy MSF venom as a malware framework to target a Windows endpoint, which will be monitored by SPLUNK to observe the attack.

Homelab testing malware detection with splunk

## Project 2 ##
Building a home lab to have a safe area to pratice malware depolyment and detection
the first part was setting up the work enviroment - a Windows 10 Pro Defender Virtual Box with a Kali linux attack box
first step in building this home lab - was to make sure all tools and enviroments on the windows system would be set tools needed will be Splunk ( free trail) also Sysmon download on the Win sys.   
the use of sysmonconfig.xml from olafhartong/sysmon-modular. the use of Powershell and CMD was used. 
the WIN sys will be a bare bones system - Defender and any and all virus protection will be turned off the main goal is to use and  </p>
